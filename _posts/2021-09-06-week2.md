## Today's Plan

- Welcome
- Early History of "Social Software"
- Activity: (finally) joining Special Fish
- Uploading a site to the Purchase server space
- Creating our Webring


### This week's Social Software: Special Fish

Each week we will try out at least one 'social software' project to evaluate and learn from. This is an evolving field and we will cover a full range of software from well-publicized social media apps to esoteric and experimental communal software. Last week we tried out walloftext.co. This week we visit Special.fish, a *directory of profiles.*

=> [Special.fish](https://special.fish)

=> [Elliot's (creator of Special.fish) profile](https://special.fish/elliott)

=> [random profile](https://special.fish/random)

Make an account. Fill out your profile with at least 2 sections, such as a text-based log, list or links. 

Sign up for the email newsletter.


Discussion:

- What is the purpose? 
- Who does it serve? 
- What kinds of pages exist (site architecture)? 
- How does the architecture and design serve the goal of the site? 
- What are the rules of the site (both explicit and implicit)?
- What are your overall impressions of Special.fish? (Is it appealing? Would you use this? Why does this exist?....)
- What questions do we have for the developer? (and or suggestions or critiques)
- What do we take from this software that we'd like to consider when creating our own work?


### Uploading sites to a server

You may have learned this before! This may be new! All students and faculty automatically have web space set up for their use. The URL looks like this: ```https://students.purchase.edu/firstname.lastname```

- [CTS Knowledge base on Purchase web space](https://collaborate.purchase.edu/CTS/Knowledge%20Base%20External/Web%20and%20File%20Space%20Support.aspx)
This document has step-by-step directions to upload your site to your personal web space via free Cyberduck (Mac) or Filezilla (Mac, Windows, Linux) software.


- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)

FileZilla: File > Site Manager > Click New Site > And plug in the server details as they appear below:

```
Host: students.purchase.edu

Servertype: FTPES - FTP over explicit TLS/SSL

Logontype: Normal

User: jane.doe

Password: Your Purchase Password

Click Connect.
```

In Cyberduck go to Open Connection and plug in the server details as they appear below:

```
FTPS

Server: students.purchase.edu

User: john.doe

Password: Your Purchase Password
```

**Your website is located inside the web folder on your server space.** Pay attention to the directory (folder) structure. Files named index.html will be automatically loaded if someone types in the URL of the path to its current directory.

### Links / References and Reading
- [Learn Web Design in 4 Minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes) (note: this is a clickbait headline but it's still a good resource!)

- The [Low Tech Webring Directory](https://emreed.net/LowTech_Directory.html).


## Homework

1. Update your CSS and content based on feedback from your classmates
2. Upload your completed webring site to your server space.
3. Read [Social Media before the Internet](https://business.time.com/2012/06/21/social-media-before-the-internet-tales-of-victorians-comic-book-fans-phone-phreaks-and-cbers/)
4. Listen to [El Paquete Semanal](https://www.artistsandhackers.org/el-paquete): An Offline Internet in Cuba. 
5. Pick a social media site or application that we haven't talked about previously in class. Write about its audience and community and specifically how it allows (or doesn't allow) for varying size of audiences and networks. For example, consider whether it supports communication between one's family or friend group, or for a much larger public. Write a post describing the expectations of users of this software. Can you find examples of users that best make use of this network? What activities disrupt this space and how does the network, software or community respond to that disruption?
