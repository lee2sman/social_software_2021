### Homework

#### Research and Write

Part 1 and 2 of this homework should be answered in a single blog post on your blog. Please link to your post for homework.

Part 1: Research 

- Listen to [Getting started on open source when you don't know where to start](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/getting-started-on-open-source-when-you-don-t-know-where-to-start) on Code Newbie podcast
- Read [Open Source Doesn't Mean More Software is Better Software](https://www.wired.com/story/more-software-isnt-better-software/)
Write a blog post.

What are some of the advantages to working in open source and list some of the criticisms. As someone potentially new to working in this space, what are your thoughts on open source software, its community and how it's built.

Part 2: Join in

You can continue to work in the open source project you began researching 2 weeks ago, or you can choose a new open source project.

* "Lurk" for a while
* Check out the culture and any license, code of conduct, statement of community, etc.
* **You should identify a concrete way that you can contribute to the project**
  * If you can't identify this, move on to another project until you find one that scratches an interest of yours and that you could conceivably contribute to
* Review the language(s) and ecosystem required to contribute.
* Review their Contributing documentation, if any. Get yourself set up with the required ecosystem (Basically, can you get a local version of the software, documentation, etc, whatever you need to run). 
* Do a first test. Replicate the testing environment, for example, if that's what is needed.
* **If appropriate**, introduce yourself (for example, in a email list, forum, etc) and/or state your intentions (for example, on a GitHub issue)

Write about your first steps taken. What community are you working in? What additional info did you find in your research? How do you see yourself contributing? What roadblocks, questions or concerns do you have? What will your next steps be?
